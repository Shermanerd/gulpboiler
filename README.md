Gulp Based Front-end Boilerplate
================================

This is just my "standard" Gulp setup for my projects. As things become a common
add for me I'll add them to this repository.

1. Download the repository
1. Copy the repository to your project
1. `cp env.js.dist env.js`
1. Open and edit the newly created env.js with the project specifics
1. `npm install`
1. `bower install`
