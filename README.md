Gulp Based Front-end Boilerplate
================================

This is just my "standard" Gulp setup for my projects. As things become a common
add for me I'll add them to this repository.

1) Download the repository
2) Copy the repository to your project
3) `cp env.js.dist env.js`
4) Open and edit the newly created env.js with the project specifics
5) `npm install`
6) `bower install`
